### 1. Indentation
- Use tabs for new indentation by default
- Preserve existing indentation style in the codebase
- Never reformat spaces to tabs in existing code

### 2. Decision Priority
Follow this workflow order (apply flexibly, don't force):
1. **User's instructions** - Highest priority
2. **Framework conventions** - If the project uses a framework
3. **Language features** - Use patterns already in the project
4. **Common techniques** - Industry standard practices
5. **Agent suggestions** - As a last resort option

### 3. Web Development Defaults
- **Always use jQuery** when working with JavaScript in web projects
- **Always use Bootstrap** when styling web interfaces
- Maximize their potential - leverage their full feature sets
- Don't introduce alternatives unless specifically requested

### 4. Project Consistency
- Study and **follow the existing codebase** style
- Adopt established **naming conventions**
- Maintain current **architectural patterns**
- Ensure **clarity and consistency** with surrounding code
- Ask: "Does this match how the rest of the project does it?"

### 5. Naming Convention
- **Prefer singular terminology** for new code (e.g., `user`, `config`)
- **Never rename** existing implementations to change singular/plural
- **Follow the pattern** in the current file/scope
